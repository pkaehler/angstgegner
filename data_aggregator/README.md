## How to start
1) Sign up for:
https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3#section/
2) Add `FOOTBALL_COM_API=<your_api_key>` as an environment variable
3) Have fun eg run `make get-league-data ENDPOINT=league` and check the data folder.
   (data folder is in gitnore, so if it is not created, feel free to do so)

This will be the source for all data handling, eg calling file_exists("data/foobar.json") would check if `.../data_aggregator/data/foobar.json` is existent.
